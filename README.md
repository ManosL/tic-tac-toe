# tic-tac-toe
It is my second game in C

Instructions: This game plays only in terminal and you write the command make and after write ./tic-tac-toe to begin the adventure.

Gameplay: First,you choose if you want to play first or second. And after that you just give the row and the clumn you want to make a move.

Implementation: The AI  algorithm is the simple minimax algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with some alpha beta 
pruning. I wrote this program on C language so you can play it on terminal.

The program was written in linux.

Have fun !!!
